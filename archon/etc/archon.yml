# A dictionary of controller name to Archon controller connection parameters. The
# detectors key determines the names and areas of each CCD in the buffer in the format
# [x0, y0, x1, y1]. The sensor key indicates the identifier (A, B, C) assigned by the
# Archon constroller to that detector.

# "apo" and "s" if "lco", {controller} which is replaced with the name of the Archon
# controller defined above, and {exposure} which is a never-repeating sequence
# identifier. The CCD frames from each controller are saved as different HDU extensions
# inside the FITS file.
