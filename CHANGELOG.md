# Changelog

## Next version

### ðŸš€ New

* [#21](https://github.com/sdss/archon/pr/21) Implemented profiles for LVM and BOSS (placeholder).
* Add option to define additional header keywords in the configuration file that read values from the actor keyword datamodel.
* Add `lvm-lab` script for laboratory testing.
* `POWERON` and `POWERBAD` controller status bits.

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

* Require `sdss-clu>=0.7.8` to allow `archon expose finish --header` to work with strings that have spaces. It should now be possible to pass commands like `archon expose finish --header '{"KEYWORD1": [1, "A comment"]}'`. For header keyword values that are a list of value and comment, the list is converted into a tuple internally so that `astropy` can parse it correctly.

### ðŸ§¹ Cleanup

* [#17](https://github.com/sdss/archon/issues/17) Handle actor shutdown more gently when it is started from the CLI either in debug mode or as a daemon.


## 0.2.1 - April 6, 2021

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

* Fix Docker creation for tags.


## 0.2.0 - April 6, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* [#10](https://github.com/sdss/archon/issues/10) Add actor command `reconnect` that allows to recreate the TCP/IP connection to one or multiple controllers. If the controller cannot be connected when the actor starts, a warning is issued but the actor will be created.
* [#11](https://github.com/sdss/archon/issues/11) Read the Govee H5179 temperature and humidity and write a basic FITS header.
* [#12](https://github.com/sdss/archon/issues/12) Add `ArchonController` methods to `abort`, `read out`, and `flush` an exposure. Actor `expose` command now accepts `expose start` and `expose finish` to allow for non-blocking integration. Better handling of status flags.

### ðŸ§¹ Cleanup

* Basic documentation.
* Use GitHub Container Registry instead of Docker Hub.


## 0.1.0 - March 6, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* Initial version of the library and actor. Supports communication with the Archon controller, Archon command tracking and reply parsing, and basic actor functionality, including exposing.
* Build and push docker image to [lvmi/archon](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lvmi/archon).
